Potential next improvements:

- Add integration tests against Redis Stack in CI.
- Add idempotent bootstrap helper for key/rule initialization.
- Add first-class percentile and histogram helpers.
- Add optional typed metric registry to reduce key/label mistakes.
- Publish generated API docs from TypeScript comments.
- Add benchmark suite for query latency and memory footprint.
